# Proof Checker - Terms of Service

**Effective Date**: [13 February, 2025.]

By using the Proof Checker bot (the "Bot"), developed by Kreo.nub, you agree to comply with the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Bot.

## 1. Bot Overview
Proof Checker is a Discord bot that helps server moderators validate users' subscriptions to specific YouTube channels. The bot works by saving server data, which includes role IDs, channel IDs, and YouTube channel names. The bot checks for messages with attachments in designated channels and verifies whether the attachments belong to the specified YouTube channels. If the attachment is verified and the user is subscribed to the respective channel, the bot grants the user a designated role.

## 2. User Responsibilities
- **Compliance**: You agree to comply with all applicable laws and Discord’s Terms of Service while using the Bot.
- **Data Integrity**: You are responsible for providing accurate information during the setup of the Bot, including role IDs, channel IDs, and YouTube channel names.
- **Respectful Use**: You agree not to misuse the Bot or use it to harass, spam, or otherwise disrupt the experience for other users.

## 3. Bot Permissions
To function properly, the Bot requires certain permissions within your Discord server:
- Manage Roles (to assign roles upon verification)
- Read and Send Messages (to interact with users in designated channels)
- Attach Files (to verify attachments)
- Manage Channels (if setup or configurations require channel modifications)

## 4. Data Collection and Privacy
The Bot collects and stores certain data provided by the server moderators during setup. This data may include:
- Role IDs
- Channel IDs
- YouTube Channel Names
- Attachments and messages from designated channels

The data collected is used solely to operate the Bot and provide the subscription verification feature. This data will not be shared with third parties unless required by law or for bot maintenance purposes.

## 5. Subscriptions and Role Assignments
The Bot verifies whether a user is subscribed to a given YouTube channel by checking the provided attachments against the specified YouTube channel. If a user is found to be subscribed, the Bot will automatically assign them a role designated by the server moderator. It is the responsibility of the server moderators to ensure the setup is accurate.

## 6. Limitations of Liability
While the Bot is designed to function reliably, Kreo.nub cannot guarantee its availability or performance. The Bot is provided on an "as-is" basis, and Kreo.nub is not responsible for any damages or issues caused by its use.

## 7. Changes to Terms
Kreo.nub reserves the right to modify or update these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Terms. Continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 8. Termination
Kreo.nub reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Bot’s service for any server or user that violates these Terms or abuses the Bot’s features.

## 9. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms or the Bot, please contact the developer, Kreo.nub, through [insert contact method].
